# Minimal React-Webpack Boilerplate

This is probably the simplest React-webpack boilerplate that you can find.

## Usage

- Install `yarn` and `nodemon` globally: `npm i yarn nodemon -g`
- Install the dependencies in the folder.: `yarn install`
- Start Webpack to watch your project: `npm run dev`
- In another tab, run `npm run server` and go to `http://localhost:3000`
