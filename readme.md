# Minimal React-Webpack Boilerplate

This is probably the simplest React-webpack boilerplate that you can find.

## Usage

- Install nodemon, browser-sync, yarb: `npm i browser-sync nodemon yarn -g`
- Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
- Start Webpack to watch your project: `npm run dev`
- In another tab, run `npm run server`
- Watch the CSS and hot reload with browsersync `npm run bs`
